                    <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
                        accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main
                        coffee-growing
                        cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
                        produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state
                        of
                        Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>

                        Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
                        bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is

                    <p>Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed
                        as
                        Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor
                        characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known
                        species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica
                        in
                        India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>
